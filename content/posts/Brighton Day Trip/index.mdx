We were at a rave on a Sunday afternoon when we got a call from our friends; they’d rented a car and invited us to go on Monday on a day trip to Brighton, as it was bank holiday. Pretty exciting news, and nothing to worry about if you’re a fresher! But in your last year of uni, spontaneous things like this scare the hell out of you instead. PARTY + DAYTRIP? that’s not a 3-day weekend, that’s summer break!
The name of this post is day trip to Brighton, but it was really more like half day trip. We were late, we got lost repeatedly, we stopped to eat… we got to Brighton well after lunchtime.
ALMA’s ADVICE: You may think you know the way, but try and listen to the Google Maps lady.
Things to do in Brighton
We walked along the beach…
If you’re used to sandy beaches, this one – or almost any beach in the UK – won’t be the one for you. But as the weather in the UK is not really your sunbathing weather anyway, these rocky beaches are perfect for walks, or chilling with friends.
Brighton Pier is a small amusement park, perfect for family quality time: a couple of rides, many funny photo boards (head in the hole) and food stands (we bought some hot dogs from one and they were pretty good).
We got a jar of Pimm’s (if you’ve never tried it, it’s a fruity summer drink I highly recommend) and an apple shisha. Then we looked for a place for dinner and ended up here. I had the best seafood pizza, while I also tried some of a friend’s mussels in white wine sauce. Not only the food was the absolute BEST, but we got views to an exceptional sunset.
Next time I’ll be in Brighton I will definitely visit the Royal Pavilion. I spotted it from the car and it’s an unbelievably beautiful building, which you really wouldn’t expect seeing in a little English town.
Banksy’s Kissing Coppers
It was already dark, but I couldn’t leave Brighton without seeing Banksy’s Kissing Coppers. I’ve been a big fan since I was about 18 and as I was in Brighton for the first time I really, really wanted to see it. At the Prince Albert Pub in Brighton, you can only find a replica of the stencil graffiti as the original mural was sold in Miami by the pub’s barman for half a million dollars.
Bansky, who refuses to reveal his real name, is an English graffiti artist, originally from Bristol, known for his controversial street art. One of Banksy’s project was Dismaland (see trailer below) – a temporary exhibition functioning as a theme park – I haven’t been there and I absolutely regret it. If you’ve been to Dismaland, let me know how it was.
ALMA’s ADVICE: If you haven’t heard of Banksy, Google him NOW!
