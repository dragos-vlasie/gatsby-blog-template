Rainy season? Burning hot outside? I’ve got the perfect fun indoors activity in Thailand for you! Art in Paradise is a 3D Museum in Thailand, open in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Pattaya. We visited the one in Chiang Mai as we spent the most of our Thai trip living there. An adult ticket cost 400 Baht (\$11), but I recommend you to look for the updated opening hours on their website. The place is not difficult to find, it’s right next to Shangri-La Hotel Chiang Mai, but it is located pretty far from the area we used to hang out (old city, MAYA Mall), so we took an Uber there. Uber is very cheap in Thailand and the cars and the drivers are super nice, so we used Uber to get around a lot. If you haven’t signed up with Uber yet, use my code almaa359ue for a free first ride.

Google warned us that the museum is very popular on Friday mornings, but I really wanted to check it out and as we had no other choice of day, on Friday morning we went. There were maybe 3-5 groups max (2-3 couples, a family with a kid and a group of 4) in the museum at the time we went, so our visit was very relaxed. There was a short waiting time on taking pictures for each display, but that didn’t bother us at al. As the whole place is a picture wonderland, ideally, you should go there in a group of min 3, so you can play (pose) around with your friends and take turns at taking snaps. I went only with Dragos and it was ok, we asked other visitors to take pictures of us and just skipped a few as we were rather exhausted after taking so many pictures. There was another couple who used a tripod for their whole visit and it seemed to work fine for them.
When the visit ended we went to the museum’s cafe to have a coffee and chill and look through the photos. The result was much better than expected to be honest, we had a great laugh seeing them – I inserted some below so have a look and let me know which one is your favourite. Personally, I liked the ‘boring’ ones, the ones that looked very real and made me feel back in Italy or Japan.
If you plan to go there, may the inspiration be with you! And if you’re not a natural poser, I recommend you go to their Instagram page and see other people’s ideas for a little ispiration.
