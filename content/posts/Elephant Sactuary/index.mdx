Elephant Nature Park | Amazing day at a REAL Thailand Elephant Sanctuary

Our plan was to leave Chiang Mai last week but we extended our trip as the Elephant Nature Park (ENP) was all booked up. If you are pressured by time and you cannot afford that luxury, you may also wanna try the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, a newer rescue camp with a smaller herd but also ethical and having very good reviews from its visitors so far.
There was no way we were gonna go ride an elephant and support the abuse in trekking camps and the so-called sanctuaries. Wild animals are NOT for our entertainment - their beauty lies in their free spirit. For this reason, we also decided not to go to the Tiger Kingdom; even though the place was not (yet) exposed for cruelty, tigers are not pets and they shouldn't be cuddling with people. This is against nature and this place is absolutely NOT protecting the endangered species by bringing up baby tigers in isolation so they never come to realise what they truly are.
At the Elephant Nature Park they rescue old elephants who suffered because of human cruelty. We booked a Single Day visit 3 or 4 weeks in advance. The experience was not cheap (£120 for 2 people), but we don't regret a single penny.
THE SINGLE DAY PACK
They picked us up from our hotel around 8:30 in the morning. It took ~1h 20 mins to get there, but in the van they played 2 videos that kept us busy. The first one was an introduction to the park's safety rules and it was quite funny. The second video was a video raising awareness of the elephant abuse, happening on such a large scale in Thailand and all around Asia actually. There was also a short interview with Lek Chailert, the founder of the park. I must say, the video was very explicit and both Dragos and I were torn apart. I don't know, something snapped inside me and I will definitely from now on not to turn a blind eye to these matters anymore.
We got to the park and our first activity was feeding the elephants. Each group was given a large basket with food, and we took turns at giving the elephant food from our hand.
After feeding the animals and washing our hands, applying sunscreen and insect repellent, our tour guide took us for a walk around the camp. The main activity of the park is taking care of the 70+ elephants, but the park is al so home to over 500 dogs rescued during the Bangkok flood in 2011, 200 cats and a dozen water buffalos saved from the slaughterhouse.
Encountering elephants, our guide told us the name of the elephant, its age (most of them are very old), its tormented past and how the abuse affected its life. We were also given time to take photos.
Several elephants have a blind eye, with 2 or 3 elephants being entirely blind. Some elephants have no teeth left and they are being fed only peeled watermelons and ripened bananas. Some have problems with their legs, hips or spine.
The most recently rescued elephant was brought to the park a month ago. It is 72 years old and despite its age, it was still forced to carry heavy logs before being saved by the ENP, and it is now both blind and deaf. So you can see it's not only about the mental damage of these animals, they are also suffering from serious physical injuries because of the mistreatment. ENP is taking special care of each of them and each elephant has its own handler/mahout.
The greatest proof of how much these people care about the well-being of elephants is the fact that they provide medicine and medical assistance for free whenever one of the elephants in the abusive camps nearby get sick, as these places don't normally even have vets or clinics.
The bitter things we've been told only made the trip more remarkable. You simply get a great feeling of being there and seeing these gentle giants now at peace. Our tour also did a lot of elephant gossiping telling us elephants’ nicknames, their peculiarities, how they get along with other elephants or with their mahout.
As you probably know, while for African Elephants both males and females have tusks, for the Asian Elephants only male do. Our favourite gossip was about the male elephant naturally losing its tusks. To quote our guide: 'This is something we call _insert name I didn't understand_ in Thai, but here at ENP we call him <<the Lady Boy'>>. I'll write the rest of the jokes at the end of this article so I don't entirely spoil the trip for you.
FACT: There aren't many male elephants at ENP. Female elephants are more often victims of abusive industries as they are easier to break and their babies can be sold.
After the walk, we went back to 'the platform' and had lunch. The lunch was entirely vegetarian but it gave plenty of tasty options. We were given about 1h for lunch, and we weren't allowed to go out in the park as the elephant handlers were having lunch as well so at this time the elephants were unsupervised and accidents could happen (and apparently nasty accidents happened in the past).
After lunch, we went for another walk. This time we saw the baby elephants, elephants taking their mud baths and elephants playing at the river.
We had a coffee and cookie break and then we went to the river to wash elephants. As the sun was burning, this soon turned into a group water fight and it was really fun.
This was the last activity of the day and we soon left for Chiang Mai. On the way back, everybody was sleeping as it was such a full day and we were all exhausted.
INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT ELEPHANTS

Elephants live around 90 years and they weigh about 400 - 500kg.
Each elephant eats around 150kg of food per day, so now you see why the ticket is so pricey.
They are very protective of their food, so don't mess around with it. As the tour guide said, their motto is simple 'No food, no friends'.
They don't sleep much, only 3-5h per day. Most of the times they sleep standing as their heavy bodies make it hard to stand up. At ENP, they build mounds so the elephants can lean on them while sleeping.
Their brain weighs around 5kg, this is why the saying that they never forget.
The gestation period of an elephant is 22 months. It can be 2 full years if a boy! Also, as they have such large bodies it is hard to tell if a female elephant is pregnant or just fat.
They look like tough giants, but elephants have very sensitive skin.
They only have 4 teeth, but these change 6 times during the elephant’s lifetime.
Despite their heavy bodies, elephants run as fast as 25mph = 40km/h

ENP ELEPHANT GOSSIP _spoiler alert_

'L. always stays alone. S. is trying to make friends with her, but L. doesn't like her!'
'These two elephants always stay together but they're not friends. They don't like each other'
'This elephant doesn't get along with his family'
'We call the baby elephant << the Trouble Maker >>. He got into a fight last week. He lost.'
'When he was born we thought he was a girl. We gave him a girl name and we posted it on Facebook so we couldn't change it when the tusks started to grow! He has a girl name now, there is no way to tell if boy or girl when they are little'
'We didn't realise she was pregnant. We found her in the shelter and she had already given birth. We call the baby << Surprise >>. We don't know who the daddy is'
'Each elephant has his own handler, but a single man is taking care of all the buffalos. We call him << the Buffalo Man >>.
