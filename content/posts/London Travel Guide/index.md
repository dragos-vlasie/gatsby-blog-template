London – short _dedicated_ guide for a 3 days visit

So you’ve finally made up your mind and decided you wanted to go to London! Great decision! London was the first metropolis in the world and is at the moment one of the most international cities in the world. Not to mention the imposing architecture, it is an amazing city just for the fact that it has SOMETHING for ANYBODY. And I’ll help you understand what’s in London for you.
I’ve lived in London for 3 years and many friends came to visit me during that time. Each of them had his own interests from the Dr Who Shop in the suburbs to the 10h spent in British Museum. All these combined with my own London experience gave me a pretty well-rounded view of the city.
If I only had 3 days in London, I wouldn’t go nuts about all those paid attractions. To be honest, I haven’t even visited them all because I think they’re overrated. Plus, unless you’ve got the cash to pay those fast track tickets everywhere, you’re gonna spend most of your time waiting in queues.
ALMA’s ADVICE: Get tickets to one or two attractions in advance and use the rest of your time to get the city’s real vibe.
Madame Tussauds is pretty isolated from the rest of attractions and there are always lots of people waiting in line so if you’ve decided to go there, take the rest of the day for yourself. Pop by the Sherlock Museum down the corner, or walk down Baker Street to Oxford Street. Oxford Street is the shopping street of London and if you’re into that, you can for sure spend the rest of the day only there. If you don’t fancy buying big-headed waving queens, turn right, see Marble Arch and go for a long walk in Hyde Park – it’s the largest park in London. There are lots of places to eat in the area, including McDonald’s, Starbucks, KFC, Itsu, Pizza Express, Pizza Hut. Out there, I usually go at Nando’s or at Tossed, a salad bar.

CUTE TIP: if you think you may end up in a London park even if just passing by, have some raw peanuts with you. There are squirrels everywhere in London’s parks and trust me, such a simple thing will just make your day.

London Dungeon and Sea Life London Aquarium are at the base of The London Eye; Big Ben, The Parliament and Westminster Abbey are just on the other site of Westminster Bridge. Spend half a day there, go around, take cool pictures then go to the Westminster Pier and take a boat to Tower Bridge. I’d buy a return ticket and go even further to Greenwich. While the boat will turn around it will give you time to take some great shots of the Big Ben. Plus, all the guides I’ve met on there cruises were really funny guys – always had a good time while finding out lots of interesting things about the riverside architecture of London.
Your return ticket is available all day so it’s up to you how long you’d stay in Greenwich – you can return to Tower Bridge as soon as 20 minutes with the next boat or spend more time and go to Greenwich park or the Maritime Museum.
The Buckingham palace itself is not an amazing architectural piece, but I definitely recommend spending one morning seeing the Change of Guards – it’s a show not to be missed! Go there around 10 in the morning and get yourself a decent spot.
Entry to museums in London is free, while they all suggest a £5 donation. You have surely heard of the British Museum and The National Gallary, but my personal recommendations are: Tate Modern Museum, the Natural History Museum – an architectural masterpiece, the Science Museum – it’s fun as they offer lots if interactive displays and V&A, Victoria and Albert Museum – museum of art and design. The last 3 are all in the same area and while there, to Harrods is a short walk.

Places to eat
In all honesty, in London that’s very dependent on your budget. We love a Japanese restaurant in Camden called Bento Café. For cakes, I always go to L’ETO Caffe or Princi. Eating in pubs may be the best idea for you as the food is good, it’s almost always decent priced and it’s quite an authentic experience. Expect 5£ for a pint and about 10£ for a burger. Try fish and chips or scampi and chips while in London. Wetherspoon’s is a pub chain in London, there must be one around you. My favourite pubs in London are the Silver Cross and Garrick Arms based near Leicester Sq and Charring Cross.
You can always have a quick meal at Itsu, Wasabi, Pret A Manger, EAT.

Places to drink

Ok, maybe my favourite part of this article. For a dance night try The O Bar, Be At One, or our absolute favourite for amazing atmosphere, amazing cocktails and late happy hour Zebranos. For burgers and very yum cocktails try Giraffe Cocktails and Burgers.
And lastly, even if you’re in London for a day, go to a musical or a play. I can’t tell you how much we love it – Wicked has a wicked décor, while Matilda’s soundtrack will make your playlist for many days after. Les Miserables is also a great choice. We weren’t that impressed with The Lion King. In terms of theatre, there are high chances this will be your chance to see that one actor you always wanted to see. We wend and saw The End of Longing by Matthew Perry and sat 10m from the one and only Chandler (Friends; yeah, older and slightly fatter but still Chandler). For tips and tricks on how to get cheap tickets I’ll write another post soon. Or just contact me.

Now you’re ready, enjoy London!

Ah, don’t forget to buy your Oyster card! It’s £5 deposit that you’d get back if you return it to a tube station before leaving London. Get a Travel Card if you stay about a week. If your stay is very short, buying a Day Card might be a better idea.

\*Tate Modern Museum – amazing exhibits including Picasso, Pollock, Brancusi; situated just over the Millennum Bridge from St Paul’s Cathedral.
FANCY LONDON
These are places with great views and top service. I call them fancy as they’re not places I’d afford going everyday, but you are on holiday! The ultimate dining experience is definitely at The Shard, the tallest building in Europe. You can book a table in advance or just walk in for a drink at one of their 2 bars.
The Madison has a great view to St Paul’s Cathedral. Sushi Samba and Sky Garden are other two restaurants offering stunning views to their customers.
Pretty much any place in Covent Garden would do for your special evening too.

Michelin-star awarded Sketch may be the most instagrammable place for their atypical venue with an entirely pink room, their afternoon tea gallery (The Glade room) and their futuristic loos.
