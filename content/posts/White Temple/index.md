If you’re looking for things to do in Chiang Mai, I have the perfect day trip! 3h by coach from the city, there is Wat Rong Khun, or how foreigners know it, The White Temple.
I have a habit of scrolling Instagram like a maniac in order to find new places that I wanna visit. After a while of doing this, you kinda start to see what places are actually beautiful and what photos are taken with a killer camera or from a good angle. On Instagram, I found the White Temple and I instantly knew I wanted to see it: CONTEMPORARY ART, ARCHITECTURE, BUDDHISM?! SAY NO MORE!
Wat Rong Khun or the White Temple is a Buddhist Temple in Chiang Rai, built as a contemporary, unconventional, Thai national art exhibition.
The temple was designed and is owned entirely by a single person as he didn’t accept any sponsors or donations, saying that these will later want to influence his work. He earned his money by selling his art – mainly paintings known for incorporating Buddhist imagery. In the past, Ajarn Chalermchai Kositpipat painted up to 200 pieces a year. Now he dedicated all his time to perfecting the White Temple instead. Chalermchai Kositpipat attended the best university of arts in Thailand. He spoke about the fact that in his course, national Thai art there were only 3 people, while everybody was fascinated by international art, Monet, Manet etc. Since then, he wanted to do something to make Thai art well-known worldwide. The temple was opened to visitors in 1997, but Chalermchai Kositpipat says the project will take about 90 years to complete. He now has a team of young artists, designers and architects that he instructs into taking care of his work after he passes away. The White Temple is renovated yearly, and Chalermchai Kositpipat walks around the temple every morning and every evening to make sure everything is just perfect.
The temple is entirely white as Chalermchai K. considered that the usual golden used for Buddhist temples is a symbol of concern for material wealth, while white is a symbol of purity. The edges of the temple are covered in small mirrors, in the symbol of the wisdom of Buddha that shines throughout the universe. This also gives the temple a unique sharpening and a magnifique glow in the Thai sun.
The temple’s interior is very peculiar as well. The temple has a mural depicting Superman, SailorMoon, Pikachu, Totoro, Mickael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Kung Fu Panda, the Toruk Makto from Avatar and many others. I promise you will find your hero there, but unfortunately, Ajarn’s reason for painting these is not what you’d expect. They aren’t there to bring you joy or excitement, their mission is to remind you that there aren’t heroes in this world. His belief is that all these heroes were born from the constant decline of human morality.
‘Eventually the world becomes ill, not only with the environment, but also with the people. People lack moral standards. That is why I portray evil people as the demon with mouth opened encircled the entrance of the temple. When people walk out, they will feel that they leave the demon behind that is they have rid themselves from the evil spirits…’
FUN FACT: the temple’s GOLDEN TOILET was built to be the most beautiful toilet in the world. You can go and see it (read ‘try it’) in order to avoid a 10 baht fee at the toilet in the shopping centre outside the temple.
PLAN YOUR DAY
We bought return tickets online at Greenbus and left early in the morning. The bus dropped us in front of the temple, but at return it didn’t stop there. We took a songtaew (red pick-up truck taxi) to the bus station in Chiang Rai just in tme for the last bus to Chiang Mai of the day – we had to buy new tickets as we missed our bus.
When we got to Chiang Rai we were very hungry so we ate at a pizza place there. The pizza was unreasonably expensive so we got 2 burgers for 100 baht each, fried and samosa. The food was really good. Around the temple, there are many places where you can enjoy a cup of coffee or a smoothie.
The entrance fee to the temple is 50 baht. Cover your knees and shoulders, or rent a white piece of cloth from one of the shops outside the temple for 20baht (and 100 baht deposit).
